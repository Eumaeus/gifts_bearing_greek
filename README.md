# Furman University Â· GIFTs Bearing Greek

This repository hosts Jupyter Notebook that use Scala and some simple plain-text template-files to generate [`.gift` formatted quiz questions compatible with Moodle.](https://docs.moodle.org/38/en/GIFT_format)

These notebooks use the [Almond kernel](https://almond.sh/).  You can run a notebook server with the Almond kernel using a docker container like this:

    docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 almondsh/almond:0.9.0

You can also work interactively with these notebooks on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Eumaeus/gifts_bearing_greek/master?filepath=index.ipynb).

If you have Jupyter Notebooks installed locally, with the Almond kernal, you can run this with:

    jupyter notebook

This work is based on that of [Neel Smith](https://github.com/neelsmith/nomisma-jupyter).
